# Coding-Challenges

This contains some of the coding challenges that I have timed myself on in Java. These challenges include reversing the characters in a string (ex. "abc123" becomes "321cba"), reversing the words of a string (ex. "My name is Ryan" becomes "Ryan is name My"), Pig Latin translator (takes the first letter to the end and adds "ay"), and a number guessing game (Computer picks a number between 1 and 10, you guess the number).
